*login page

1- moved user's name to the top 
2-modified the image and made it in the middle of the page
3- added logout button 
4- moved change password to be alongside the logout button
5- since we are making login, its not secure to check the password as it is, i assumed we are using base 64 encoding
(which is not the nest solution to encrypt password but as you asked am not using a hashing library) to save the password in the DB,
 and checked the password if it match the encrypted password.
6- we need to generate a user access tokken from server side to check if the login is authinticated, and save in the local storage, 
when logout i clear it from the memory
